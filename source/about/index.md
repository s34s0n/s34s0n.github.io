My name is Season Cherian, Iâ€™m a Cyber Security researcher at team [bi0s](https://bi0s.in/).

My main focus right now is having a depth understanding of Hardware Security.

When not doing the later, I enjoy speaking/attending local meetups and discuss anything related to programming, books, music, life, movies, TV shows and everything in between.
